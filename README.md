## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!
Hello, my name is Ansh Desai and I am a second year at the University of Delaware. I am pursuing a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BS in Computer Science. Currently, my research interests lie in numerical analysis and scientific computing. Feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:ansh@uchicago.edu">email</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ansh-desai-444145250/" rel="external">Linkedin</a>, or <a href="https://udel.joinhandshake.com/stu/users/49917011" rel="external">Handshake</a>!  
## ðŸ–¥ Projects
<ul>
  <li> <strong>Helmholtz Scattering:</strong> The codebase for generating synthetic far field data for the Helmholtz inverse scattering problem discussed in our paper
<em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01596" target="_blank">
      A. Desai, T. Lahivaara, and P. Monk. Neural-enhanced Born approximation for inverse scattering. Preprint, arXiv:2503.01596, 2025.</a></em>
  <li> <strong>Radiation Transport Solver: </strong> A numerical solver for the radiation transport equation using both source iteration and Diffusion Synthetic Acceleration (DSA). The solver handles piecewise-constant media and boundary conditions, discretized via a Petrov-Galerkin finite element method with SUPG stabilization.
  <li> <strong>HealthIndia:</strong> Earned second place for the Telmedicine & AI in LMICs challenge at HopHacks Fall 2024. The application utilizes AI-driven speech generation and audio processing, along with support for multiple languages, to efficiently gather on-demand, comprehensive medical histories from villagers in remote and rural regions of India.</li>
  <li> <strong>PC19:</strong> A novel, adaptive-step differential equation solver for initial value problems that outperforms classical MATLAB algorithms by over 20%. The solver is based on an increasing-order, Adams-Bashforth-Moulten predictor-corrector scheme. Advised by Dr. Mark Gockenbach.
