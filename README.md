## üëã Hi!
Hello, my name is Ansh Desai and I am a first year at the University of Delaware. I am pursuing a BS in Applied Mathematics and a BS in Computer Science. Currently, I have been performing mathematical research on numerical methods for ordinary differential equations under the supervision of Dr. Mark Gockenbach.
